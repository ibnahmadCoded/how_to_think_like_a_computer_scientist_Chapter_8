The math module in python has 50 functions

math.ceil returns an integer greater than the
argument (float). If not x.0, it returns the 
next integer after x, else it returns x. 

math.floor does the same as math.ceil, but it
returns the previous integer lower than x, if
not x.0. Else it returns x. 

To compute square roots before now, we have been use the Newton's approximation 
formulae, whereby each iteration of the calc
brings us closer to the sqrt value, until we
have reached a threshold difference btw our
guessed qrt and the current calculation.

there are five data constansts in the current
python version, and they are pi, e, inf, nan
and tau.
